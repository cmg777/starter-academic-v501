title: "Regional income convergence and conditioning factors in Turkey: Revisiting the role of spatial dependence and neighbor effects"
event:  Chennai Mathematical Institute and XKDR Forum Workshop
event_url: https://www.papers.xkdr.org/index.html
location: India and Virtual
summary:  Chennai Mathematical Institute and XKDR Forum Workshop 
abstract: "This presentation provides an introduction to the analysis of geospatial development. Specifically, it covers the following three topics:  (1) What is geospatial development? How does it complement micro and macro studies? (2) How can we study geospatial development? How important are satellite images in measuring geospatial development? (3) What is spatial data science? In which way is it different from standard data science? The presentation concludes by highlighting some additional learning materials and tutorials."
