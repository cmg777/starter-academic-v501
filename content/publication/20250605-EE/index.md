abstract: "We evaluate the robustness of the regional Kuznets curve using the Bayesian average of classical estimates for panel data and identify the robust determinants of regional inequality. Our simulation exercise suggests that this method recovers the variables underlying the true data generating process. Our results indicate that in addition to real GDP per capita, linear and quadratic, the most robust determinants of regional inequality are natural resource rents, arable land and ethnic inequality. We Ô¨Ånd an inverted-U-shaped relationship between regional inequality and national development in the range of USD 189 to USD 71,682. Beyond this threshold, there is evidence suggesting inequality stabilization."

## üó∫Ô∏è Motivation

* Regional inequality shapes social cohesion, migration & political stability
* Kuznets (1955): inverted-U link between development & inequality
* Recent evidence hints at more complex (N-shaped) patterns
* Need robust econometric tools to settle the ‚Äúshape‚Äù debate

---

## üìö Literature Snapshot

* Inverted-U support: List & Gallet (1999); Thornton (2001)
* Mixed / non-U evidence: Tam (2008); Huang (2012)
* N-shape claim: Lessmann (2014); Lessmann & Seidel (2017)
* Gap: model uncertainty rarely addressed explicitly

---

## üéØ Research Goals

* Extend Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE) to panel fixed-effects
* Test the robustness of Kuznets curve shape under model uncertainty
* Identify determinants that consistently drive regional inequality

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology Highlights

* **Search space:** 14 candidate regressors ‚Üí 2¬π‚Å¥ = **16 384** models, each estimated with two-way (country + period) fixed effects.
* **Robustness sweep:** Allowing four fixed-effects options (none, time, country, two-way) expands the universe to **65 536** models; posterior model probabilities (PMPs) concentrate entirely on the two-way specification.
* **Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE):**

  * Retains simple FE-OLS for every model‚Äîno heavy MCMC.
  * Translates each model‚Äôs BIC into an approximate marginal likelihood.
  * Uses a uniform prior so PMPs sum to 1, then forms **probability-weighted averages** for all coefficients, predictions, and derivatives.
* **Variable screening:** Posterior Inclusion Probability (PIP) highlights robust determinants‚Äî‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù at PIP ‚â• 0.75, ‚Äústrong‚Äù at PIP ‚â• 0.90.
* **Curve peaks:** Inequality turning points come from the BACE-weighted derivative of the cubic GDP polynomial, with analytic standard errors for credible bands.
* **Validation:** Monte-Carlo experiments with a known data-generating process show BACE pinpoints the correct fixed-effects structure and true drivers, underscoring the method‚Äôs reliability.

## üìà Data Overview

* 180 countries, five 5-year windows (1990-2013)
* Dependent variable: population-weighted Gini from satellite night-lights
* Key covariates (14): GDP pc (linear‚Äìquintic), resource rents, arable land, ethnic Gini, trade, FDI, etc.

---

## üß™ Simulation Check

* Simulated panel with known DGP
* BACE recovered:

  * Correct two-way FE spec (PMP ‚âà 100 %)
  * True drivers (GDP pc, rents, land, ethnic Gini)

---

## üîç Determinant Robustness (Real Data)

**High PIP (> 0.75)**

* Natural-resource rents ‚Üë inequality
* Arable land share ‚Üì inequality
* Ethnic Gini ‚Üë inequality
  **Kuznets terms**
* GDP pc (linear & quadratic) robust
* Cubic term not robust (PIP ‚âà 0.48)

---

## üìê Shape of the Curve

* Inequality **rises**: USD 189 ‚Üí 2 189
* **Stabilises**: USD 2 189 ‚Üí 3 935
* **Falls**: USD 3 935 ‚Üí 71 682
* **Stabilises** again beyond USD 71 682

> Evidence favours an inverted-U with plateau in rich economies, **not** a full N-shape.

---

## üß≠ Policy Takeaways

* Redistribute natural-resource rents across regions
* Invest in agricultural productivity & equitable land access
* Target ethnic inclusion to curb spatial disparities
* Growth alone won‚Äôt close gaps after the peak‚Äîactive regional policy required

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

* Panel-BACE offers transparent, probabilistic insight into inequality drivers
* Robust inverted-U confirmed; inequality stabilises, not rebounds, at high incomes
* Future work: interact technology diffusion & institutions in the Kuznets framework
