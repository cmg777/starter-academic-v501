## Description

Macroeconomics is one of the most fascinating disciplines within the social sciences. It helps us find some answers to key questions regarding the economic life of a country and the whole world. For example: Why are some countries rich and others poor? Why are there global economic crises and costly economic fluctuations? What determines the level of national unemployment and inflation? What is the role of monetary and fiscal policy? In the context, the overall goal of this course is to study both short-run economic fluctuations (e.g., recessions and depressions) and frontier topics in long-run economic growth (e.g., productivity and convergence). In particular, after introducing the analytical foundations of some workhorse macroeconomic models, we focus on the empirical application of such models in the context of developing countries. A central component of the course is on how to analyze the evolution of the overall economy in response to changes in policy and economic shocks.

By the end of this course, students are expected to develop the following proficiencies:

1. Track down key stylized facts and handle global data about the short-run fluctuations and long-run patterns of key macroeconomic variables such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, among others.
2. Develop an understanding of the main models of short-run economic fluctuations. 
3. Evaluate and summarize some of the most recent findings in the literature of long-run economic growth.
4. Critically evaluate under what conditions government policy can have a positive effect on short-run economic fluctuations and long-run economic growth.
5. Utilize macroeconomic data, models, and basic simulation methods to prepare an analysis of the short-run fluctuations and long-run growth of developing countries.
