In this case study, we use the Differences in Differences (DiD) method to analyze the effect of a garbage incinerator's location on housing prices. This method is a statistical technique used in econometrics that calculates the effect of a treatment (in this case, the placement of a garbage incinerator) on an outcome (here, housing prices) by comparing the average change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment group to the average change over time for the control group. You can run and extend the analysis of this case study using [Posit cloud](https://posit.cloud/content/6182152) or  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14LJEYHZTlw5wtIK0bR0lOza7lQiO0krc?usp=sharing).
