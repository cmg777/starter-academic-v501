## Homogeneous Treatment Effects

- 🎯 **Purpose**: 
  Estimates treatment effects when the treatment is not randomly assigned.
- 📉 **Parallel Trends Assumption**: 
  Assumes that in the absence of treatment, the treated and untreated groups would have followed parallel paths over time.
- 🔄 **Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE) Model**:
  - **Static Model**:

  $$
  y_{igt} = \mu_g + \eta_t + \tau D_{gt} + \epsilon_{igt}
  $$

    - $ y_{igt} $: Outcome variable.
    - $ i $: Individual.
    - $ t $: Time.
    - $ g $: Group.
    - $ \mu_g $: Group fixed-effects.
    - $ \eta_t $: Time fixed-effects.
    - $ D_{gt} $: Indicator for treatment status.
    - $ \tau $: Average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).
- ❗ **Limitations**: 
  Assumes constant treatment effects across groups and time, which is often unrealistic.

## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

- 🔄 **Enhanced TWFE Model**:
  $$
  y_{igt} = \mu_g + \eta_t + \tau_{gt} D_{gt} + \epsilon_{igt}
  $$
  - Allows treatment effects ($ \tau_{gt} $) to vary by group and time.
  - Aggregates group-time average treatment effects into an overall average treatment effect ($ \tau $).

## Dynamic Event-Study TWFE Model

- 🔄 **Model**:
  $$
  y_{igt} = \mu_g + \eta_t + \sum_{k=-L}^{-2} \tau_k D_{gt}^k + \sum_{k=0}^{K} \tau_k D_{gt}^k + \epsilon_{igt}
  $$
  - Allows for treatment effects to change over time.
  - $ D_{gt}^k $: Lags and leads of treatment status.
  - Coefficients ($ \tau_k $) represent the average effect of being treated for $ k $ periods.

- 🎯 **Estimation Goals**:
  - **Objective**: Estimate the average treatment effect of being exposed for $ k $ periods.
  - **Average Treatment Effect**:
    $$
    \tau_k = \sum_{g,t : t-g=k} \frac{N_{gt}}{N_k} \tau_{gt}
    $$
    - $ N_{gt} $: Number of observations in group $ g $ and time $ t $.
    - $ N_k $: Total number of observations with $ t - g = k $.


## Negative Weighting Problem

- ❗ **Issue**: Traditional TWFE models can produce estimates with negative weights, leading to biased overall treatment effect estimates.
- 🛠 **Solution by Gardner (2021)**:
  - Use a two-stage approach to estimate group and time fixed-effects from untreated/not-yet-treated observations and then estimate treatment effects using residualized outcomes.

## Two-stage differences in differences

- 🌱 **Gardner (2021) Approach**:

  - 🔍 **Key Insight**: Under parallel trends, group and time effects are identified from the untreated/not-yet-treated observations.

  - 📜 **Procedure**:

    1. 🥇 **First Stage**:

       - Estimate the model:

         \begin{equation}
         y_{igt} = \mu_g + \eta_t + \epsilon_{igt}
         \end{equation}

       - Using only untreated/not-yet-treated observations ($D_{gt} = 0$).
       - Obtain estimates for group and time effects ($\mu_g$ and $\eta_t$).

    2. 🥈 **Second Stage**:

       - Regress adjusted outcomes ($y_{igt} - \mu_g - \eta_t$) on treatment status ($D_{gt}$) in the full sample to estimate treatment effects ($\tau$).

  - 🎯 **Rationale**:

    - The parallel trends assumption implies that residuals ($\epsilon_{igt}$) are uncorrelated with the treatment dummy, leading to a consistent estimator for the average treatment effect.
