**üìä Global 1 km √ó 1 km Gridded Revised Real GDP and Electricity Consumption (1992‚Äì2019) üåç**

### **üìå Introduction**
- This study presents a high-resolution (1 km √ó 1 km) global dataset of real GDP and electricity consumption from 1992 to 2019.
- The dataset is based on nighttime light data, calibrated using a novel **Particle Swarm Optimization-Back Propagation (PSO-BP) algorithm**.
- The aim is to provide a more accurate and continuous measurement of economic activity worldwide.

### **üí° Background & Significance**
- üìà **GDP** and ‚ö° **electricity consumption** are key indicators of economic development.
- Traditional economic statistics often suffer from **inconsistencies**, especially in developing countries.
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Nighttime light data** from satellites has been widely used to estimate economic output, but previous approaches had **limitations** in accuracy and continuity.

---

### **üóÇÔ∏è Methodology**
#### **üìö Data Sources**
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Nighttime Light Data:** 
  - Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (**DMSP/OLS**) 
  - National Polar-orbiting Partnership‚Äôs Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (**NPP/VIIRS**)
- üìä **GDP Data:** Official GDP statistics from **175 countries**, revised using nighttime light data.
- ‚ö° **Electricity Consumption Data:** Collected for **134 countries**.

#### **‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing & Calibration**
- **üñ•Ô∏è Image Unification:** 
  - Applied **PSO-BP algorithm** to standardize DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS data.
  - Adjusted for **sensor inconsistencies and temporal discontinuities**.
- **üìç Grid-Level Estimation:** 
  - GDP and electricity consumption distributed using a **top-down approach**.
  - Revised **real GDP growth** based on a weighted combination of **official statistics** and **nightlight-derived estimates**.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Correction Mechanisms:**
  - Eliminated **biases** in nighttime light intensity.
  - Accounted for **regional heterogeneity** in economic activities.
  - Applied inter-annual continuous series correction to ensure temporal consistency in nighttime light data.

#### **üîç PSO-BP Algorithm for Data Calibration**
- **üîÑ Training Process:**
  - Used **artificial neural networks** to train a model mapping relationships between GDP, electricity consumption, and nighttime light intensity.
  - Divided the data into **training (60%) and testing (40%)** samples.
  - Applied **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** to optimize the **Back Propagation (BP) neural network**.
  - Iterated **50 times with 20 population size** to refine model accuracy.

- **üìâ Data Matching Across Sensors:**
  - Addressed discrepancies between **DMSP/OLS (1992‚Äì2013)** and **NPP/VIIRS (2012‚Äì2019)** by:
    - Applying **pixel-level calibration**.
    - Ensuring consistency in spatial patterns by matching high/low DN values.
    - Normalizing DN values and applying machine learning for seamless integration.

- **üìä Estimation of GDP and Electricity Consumption:**
  - Derived **GDP growth rate** as a function of **official GDP and nighttime light data**.
  - Applied **weights (œÅ = 0.94 for developed countries, œÅ = 0.66 for developing countries)** to adjust official GDP growth.
  - Estimated electricity consumption growth using a **combined function of GDP and light intensity growth**.

  - üåé **Cross-sectional Analysis**: Strong correlation (**R¬≤ ~ 0.87**) between **sum of DN values** and **national GDP/electricity consumption**.
  - Validated **temporal consistency** of corrected light data across years.

- **ü§ñ Validation of PSO-BP Algorithm**
  - Trained the PSO-BP model using **national GDP, electricity consumption, and nighttime light data**.
  - Achieved an **R¬≤ > 0.99** in training and testing datasets, confirming model robustness.
  - Outperformed previous models with improved **spatiotemporal consistency**.
  - Compared **simulated GDP/electricity consumption** with **external datasets**, showing strong alignment.
