## 🌐 Context and Motivation

Adopted in 2015, the **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development** established 17 Sustainable Development Goals. While global metrics offer useful benchmarks, they often overlook subnational disparities—particularly in heterogeneous countries such as Bolivia.

- 🇧🇴 Bolivia ranks **79/166** on the 2020 SDG Index (score: 69.3)  
- 🏘️ The *[Municipal Atlas of the SDGs in Bolivia 2020](http://atlas.sdsnbolivia.org)* reveals **intra-national disparities** comparable to **global inter-country variation**  

---

## 📊 Development Index: Índice Municipal de Desarrollo Sostenible (IMDS)

The **Municipal Sustainable Development Index (IMDS)** summarizes municipal performance using 62 indicators across 15 Sustainable Development Goals. However, systematic and reliable information on goals 12 and 14 were not available at the municipal level.

### 🎯 Methodological Criteria

- ✅ Relevance to local Sustainable Development Goal targets  
- 📥 Data availability from official or trusted sources  
- 🌐 Full municipal coverage (339 municipalities)  
- 🕒 Data mostly from 2012–2019  
- 🧮 Low redundancy between indicators

- Many indicators based on 2012 Census; updates pending  
- Limited information for Goals 12 and 14 at municipal level  
- No indicators for educational quality (due to lack of standardized testing)  
- Gender violence data unavailable at municipal scale
