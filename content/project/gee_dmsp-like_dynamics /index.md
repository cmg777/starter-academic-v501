**Title Slide**
- **A Harmonized Global Nighttime Light Dataset (1992‚Äì2018)**
- Authors: Xuecao Li, Yuyu Zhou, Min Zhao, & Xia Zhao
- Published in: Scientific Data (2020)
- DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0510-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0510-y)

**üåç Introduction**
- Nighttime light (NTL) data provide insights into human activity, urbanization, and economic development.
- Two primary sources: **DMSP/OLS (1992‚Äì2013)** & **VIIRS (2012‚Äì2018)**.
- Challenge: Significant inconsistency between DMSP and VIIRS data.
- Objective: Develop a **harmonized global NTL dataset** for long-term analysis.

---

**üë©‚Äçüíª Data Collection**
- **DMSP/OLS NTL Data (1992‚Äì2013):**
  - Downloaded from the Payne Institute for Public Policy.
  - Digital number (DN) values range from **0 to 63**.
  - Spatial resolution: **30 arc-seconds**.
- **VIIRS/DNB Data (2012‚Äì2018):**
  - Higher spatial & radiometric resolution.
  - Monthly composites were processed into annual data.
  - Spatial resolution: **15 arc-seconds**.

---

**üîÑ Methodology**
- **Three-step harmonization process:**
  1. **Annual Composition of VIIRS Data:**
     - Used cloud-free coverage data as a weighting factor.
     - Removed noise from aurora, fires, and temporary sources using thresholding techniques.
     - Applied a **weighted averaging approach** to generate annual composite images from monthly VIIRS data.
  2. **Conversion of VIIRS to DMSP-like Data:**
     - **Kernel Density (KD) Approach:**
       - Aggregated VIIRS radiance data (15 arc-seconds) to match DMSP resolution (30 arc-seconds).
       - Used a Gaussian point-spread function to reduce differences in radiance distribution.
     - **Logarithmic Transformation:**
       - Applied logarithmic transformation to adjust radiance variations in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
       - Reduced differences in brightness levels between high and low radiance pixels.
     - **Sigmoid Function Conversion:**
       - Developed a **sigmoid function** based on 2013 data to map transformed VIIRS data to DMSP-like DN values.
       - Parameters of the function were optimized at a global scale and validated at continental and national levels.
  3. **Integration of DMSP & VIIRS Data:**
     - Inter-calibrated DMSP data (1992‚Äì2013) using a **stepwise calibration approach**.
     - Applied derived sigmoid function to convert VIIRS data (2014‚Äì2018) into DMSP-like DN values.
     - Merged both datasets to create a **consistent 27-year global NTL dataset**.

---

**üåç Technical Validation**
- **Histogram Comparison:**
  - Compared DN distributions of inter-calibrated DMSP and VIIRS-derived DMSP-like data.
  - Verified similarity in data distributions for overlapping years (2012‚Äì2013).
  - Identified a slight increase in high DN values (>60) due to DMSP saturation effects.
- **Temporal Consistency (1992‚Äì2018):**
  - Assessed trends in total nighttime light (NTL) intensity and number of lit pixels.
  - Conducted analysis using different DN thresholds (7, 20, 30) to minimize low-luminance noise.
  - Observed a stable and continuous trend in high-luminance areas (DN > 20).
- **Spatial Validation:**
  - Evaluated spatial accuracy using major metropolitan areas (e.g., Beijing, New York).
  - Compared observed DMSP, raw VIIRS radiance, and DMSP-like VIIRS data.
  - Verified agreement in urban spatial patterns, indicating robustness of the integration approach.
- **Independent Socioeconomic Correlations:**
  - Compared trends with external socioeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, electricity consumption).
  - Strong correlations between harmonized NTL dataset and economic development patterns.
  - Ensures reliability of dataset for studies on urbanization and economic growth.

---

**üè∞ Applications of the Dataset**
- Urban expansion analysis (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin region).
- Socioeconomic studies (e.g., GDP estimation, electricity consumption).
- Environmental monitoring (e.g., light pollution, carbon emissions).
- Disaster impact assessments (e.g., conflict zones, power outages).

---

**üìä Key Findings & Conclusion**
- The **harmonized NTL dataset** enables **long-term analysis (1992‚Äì2018)**.
- Overcomes DMSP-VIIRS inconsistencies using a **systematic integration approach**.
- Provides a valuable resource for **urbanization, economics, and environmental studies**.
