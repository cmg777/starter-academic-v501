### 1. What is the academic mission of the  [QuarRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org)?

We conduct research on quantitative regional and computational science. We exploit the integration of spatial data science, econometrics, and machine learning to understand and inform the process of sustainable development across subnational regions and countries.


### 2. What are the current *lines of research* of the [QuarRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org)?

- The quantitative geography of sustainable development: Remote sensing, spatial econometrics, and spatial machine learning
- Regional growth, inequality, and convergence: Perspectives from spatial econometrics and machine learning
- Measuring the wealth and inequality of subnations: Views from outer space using satellite remote sensing
- Modeling the wealth and inequality of subnations: Spatial spillovers and spatial heterogeneity
- Spatial machine learning and development clusters



### 3. What *research methods* are commonly used to conduct research in the [QuarRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org)?

 - Geocomputational methods
 - Spatial econometrics
 - Panel data econometrics
 - Nonparametric econometrics
 - Bayesian econometrics
 - Remote sensing methods
 - Machine learning
 


### 4. How could I join the [QuarRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org)?

Official admission follows the procedures and programs described in the Admission Policy of the Graduate School of International Development at Nagoya University. Please, carefully revise the following websites.

- [Admission policy of the Graduate School of Internation Development (GSID)](http://www.gsid.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/admission/adm_policy/)
- [Application for admission and requirements ](http://www.gsid.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/admission/application/)

Among all the application requirements, we strongly recommend you write a clear and concise research proposal. Your chances of acceptance largely depend on this proposal. Since the number of applications to this research lab have been increasing, the selection process has become very competitive. Thus, to increase your chances of acceptance, you could prepare a proposal that is consistent with our previously described **lines of research** and **research methods**.  To have a more concrete reference, you could review our [research outcomes](https://quarcs-lab.org/research/), [projects](https://quarcs-lab.org/portfolio/all-publications/), [presentations](hhttps://carlos-mendez.org/#talks), and [tutorials](https://deepnote.com/carlos-mendez).


### 5. What is the  profile of those who successfully join the  [QuarRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org) as *master* students?

- Research proposal is consistent with the research lines, methods, and [projects](https://quarcs-lab.org/portfolio/all-publications/) of the QuarRCS lab
- Undergraduate-level knowledge of economics and statistics
- Ability to use statistical and mathematical software: Stata, R, Python, GeoDA, or Matlab. (at least ONE)
- High motivation to learn and use data science, spatial econometrics, and machine learning methods to conduct research.

If you believe your current background does not match this profile, but still want to join us, your could first apply as a [*Research Student*](http://www.gsid.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/admission/application/) for six months (or one year). During this time, you can develop your academic skills with us, brush up your research proposal, and prepare for the entrance examination of the master program.


### 6. What is the  profile of those who successfully join the  [QuarRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org) as *doctoral* students?

- Research proposal is *highly* consistent with the research lines, methods, and [projects](https://quarcs-lab.org/portfolio/all-publications/) of the QuarRCS lab
- *Advanced* knowledge of economics, econometrics, or statistics.
- Ability to use and *write programs* in Stata, R, Python, GeoDA, or Matlab Python. (at least TWO)
- *Plan to use* data science, spatial econometrics, and machine learning methods to conduct research.

If you believe your current background does not match this profile, but still want to join us, your could first apply as a [*Research Student*](http://www.gsid.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/admission/application/) for six months (or one year). During this time, you can develop your research skills with us, brush up your research proposal, and prepare for the entrance examination of the doctoral program.

### 7. What research projects are currently being developed by the members of the  QuarRCS-lab ?

The research interests, topics, and projects of lab's members are [listed HERE.](https://quarcs-lab.org/portfolio/all-publications/)


### 8. How should I write my research proposal?

Your research proposal should clearly state the following:

- (1) Brief background of your research topic:
    - What do you know about this topic? Why should we care about this topic?
    - What specific research publications have you read about this topic?
- (2) Research objectives and questions:
    - What specific research question do you plan to answer?
    - How do you plan to contribute to the previous literature on this topic?
- (3) Research methods:
    - How do you plan to answer your research questions?
    - What quantitative/econometric methodology do you plan to use?
- (4) Data:
    - What kind of data do you plan to use?  What variables do you plan to study?
    - What is the unit of analysis of your data? National-level? Regional-level? Industry-level? Firm-level? Individual level?
    - What is the time-horizon of your data?  Is your data available for multiple years? Is it a balanced panel dataset?
    - Can you access to the data? Is this dataset publicly available?
- (5) Implementation plan:
    - What steps will you follow to implement your research project?

### 9. What papers can I read to write my research proposal and develop an understanding of the research lines of the QuaRCS lab?

You can read the [papers written by the members of the QuaRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org/portfolio/all-publications/). You can also read the [recent papers of Prof. Carlos Mendez](https://carlos-mendez.org/#featured). Finally, you can also check [the reading list of the QuaRCs lab](https://www.mendeley.com/community/quarcs-lab/)
