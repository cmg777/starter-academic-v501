# Overview of the Event

The Asian Satellite Campuses Institute (ASCI), the Graduate School of International Development (GSID), and the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE) of Nagoya University, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Cambodia and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), are pleased to organize the research seminar entitled **"Integrating Satellite and Socioeconomic Data for Monitoring Sustainable Development in Cambodia."** 

In the new era of artificial intelligence and big data, this research seminar serves as a platform for interdisciplinary research collaboration, bringing together experts from diverse fields such as:

- üåç **Space-Earth Environmental Studies**
- üìä **Economics**
- üå± **Development Studies**
- üó∫Ô∏è **Area Studies**
- üíª **Data Science**
- üåê **Geoinformatics**

The seminar aims to provide an overview of new data and methods to monitor sustainable development in Cambodia. Specifically, participants will explore innovative approaches to enhance our understanding of sustainable development by integrating satellite images with socioeconomic surveys and administrative data.

Additionally, the seminar provides networking opportunities designed to foster research collaboration among participants. These interactions will facilitate the exchange of ideas, the development of new research projects, and the establishment of long-term professional connections. By bringing together scholars with diverse expertise, the seminar encourages the creation of interdisciplinary and international partnerships that can lead to innovative research outcomes.
