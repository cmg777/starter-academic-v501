## Overview of the event

In collaboration with the United Nations Development Program  in Cambodia, the Asian Satellite Campuses Institute, Graduate School of International Development and Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research of Nagoya University are pleased to organize the research seminar entitled "Integrating satellite and socioeconomic data for monitoring sustainable development in Cambodia". In the new era of artificial intelligence and big data, this research seminar serves as a platform for interdisciplinary research collaboration, bringing together experts from diverse fields such as space-earth environmental studies, economics, development studies, area studies, data science, and geoinformatics.

The seminar aims to provide an overview of new data and methods to monitor sustainable development in Cambodia. Specifically, participants will explore innovative approaches to enhance our understanding of sustainable development by integrating satellite images with socioeconomic surveys and administrative data. 

The seminar also aims to provide  networking opportunities designed to foster research collaboration among participants. These interactions will facilitate the exchange of ideas, the development of new research projects, and the establishment of long-term professional connections. By bringing together scholars with diverse expertise, the seminar encourages the creation of interdisciplinary and international partnerships that can lead to innovative research outcomes.
